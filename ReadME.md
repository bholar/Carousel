Week6 Task
This project shows us how to build and how carousel/slides work.
Most times we visit web sites and see beautiful slides and we just think in our heads "oh i like this",and never really try to know how it was made. As deevelopers these are questions we must ask and of course attempt.

FAQ
Whats is a carousel on a website?
Also known as sliders, galleries, and slideshows, web carousels let you display text, graphics, images, and even video in one interactive, “sliding” block. They're a great design option for grouping content and ideas together—allowing you to form visual relationships between specific pieces of content.
