# Week6 Task

This project shows us how to build and how carousel/slides work.
Most times we visit web sites and see beautiful slides and we just think in our heads "oh i like this",and never really try to know how it was made. As deevelopers these are questions we must ask and of course attempt.
## FAQ

#### Whats is a carousel on a website?
Also known as sliders, galleries, and slideshows, web carousels let you display text, graphics, images, and even video in one interactive, ‚Äúsliding‚Äù block. They're a great design option for grouping content and ideas together‚Äîallowing you to form visual relationships between specific pieces of content.
